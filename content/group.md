text="The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. [Credits](https://images.nasa.gov/details-GSFC_20171208_Archive_e000393.html)." >}}

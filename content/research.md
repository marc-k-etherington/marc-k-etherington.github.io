mission = """
We investigate the fundamental photophysics of organic light-emitting materials, with a particular focus on thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Our research spans from molecular design principles to device applications, combining advanced spectroscopy, computational modeling, and synthesis. We aim to understand and control excited state dynamics to enable next-generation technologies in displays, lighting, and bioimaging.

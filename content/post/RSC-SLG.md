The group has been awarded Â£10k from the Royal Society of Chemistry as part of their Sustainable Laboratories Grant. This project entitled GHOSTS will explore green and halogen free solvents for thermally activated delayed fluorescence spectroscopy. This money will be used to hire a short term research assistant to undertake the work. This will be an exciting project that should improve laboratory practice in our group and elsewhere.

Marc has presented some of the group's recent work on controlling charge transfer in caged quinoline systems. We have developed a modular synthetic pathways that gives fine control of the N-aryl distance and hence the charge transfer state formation. This gives fundamental insight into the processes as well as allowing control of emission colour.

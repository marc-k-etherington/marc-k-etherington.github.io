This past week Ruth and Marc have been in Dresden (Germany) representing the group at the International Conference on Science and Technology of Synthetic Electronic Materials (ICSM). This is a major international conference in our field and always great fun. Ruth presented a poster on her recent work and Marc presented a talk on the collaborative work between our group and that of Prof. Patrick Steel at Durham University. It is also a great social event to catch up with friends and colleagues and the conference dinner on a boat on the Elbe was a treat.

Ruth presented some of her work on the carbazole-pyridinium systems that we have been working on in collaboration with the University of Glasgow. She has demonstrated how the methylation of the nitrogen atom of the quinoline moiety can enhance the thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties of these compounds and still retains blue emission.

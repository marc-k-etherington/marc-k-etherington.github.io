As part of the Energy Futures Network I was host to Hannah Hamilton who gave some insight into the RSC's vision for their energy and green chemistry portfolio of journals. This was hugely relevant to the wide diversity of academics that we have in the Energy Futures Network. Thanks Hannah for your time!

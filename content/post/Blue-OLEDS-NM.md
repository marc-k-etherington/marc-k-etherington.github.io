show_summary: true

Working alongside the universities of Cambridge, Imperial and Loughborough we have provided insight into how to improve blue OLEDs by minimising unwanted energy transfer to the triplet states (https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/brighter-cheaper-blue-light-could-revolutionise-screen-technology/). This work was published in Nature Materials (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-024-01812-4) and is a great demonstration of the powerful insight that collaborative research can achieve.

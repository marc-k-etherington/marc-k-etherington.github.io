Ruth presented some of her work on the carbazole-pyridinium systems that we have been working on in collaboration with the University of Glasgow as a joint flash talk and poster. She has demonstrated how the methylation of the nitrogen atom of the quinoline moiety can enhance the thermally activated delayed fluorescence properties of these compounds and still retain blue emission. This was Ruth's first talk at an international conference and she did a great job!

Every year we make sure to take the time to get together as a group and reflect on the past year. 2025 is no different. This year we were also joined by our long-time collaborator Dr Mark Sims. It has become a bit of a tradition in our group to go for a curry rather than the traditional fayre.

This year we mixed it up even further with adding a trip to La Gamba for a pre-lunch vermouth aperitif. Lunch itself was at Dakwala followed by coffee at Pink Lane and a final round of cheers at a-x-i-s. It is a pleasure to support these fantastic local businesses and it is one great positive of being a city-based campus in such a vibrant city as Newcastle upon Tyne.

Merry Christmas Everyone!

It was a great pleasure to host Prof. Andy Monkman from Durham University as part of our very first Enrichment Week in the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering at Northumbria University. Andy gave a fantastic talk on how organic light-emitting materials have revolutionised display technology and how they are continuing to have impact in the industry. Inspiring our 2nd year students to think about where their degree can take them.

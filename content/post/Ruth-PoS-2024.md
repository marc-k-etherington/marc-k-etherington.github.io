Pint of Science is an international initiative that started in the UK and is about science communication in pubs, cafes and other public places (https://pintofscience.co.uk/). Ruth helped host a local event in Newcastle and some of the speakers were from our very own NUPV group at Northumbria. A great evening was had by all and well done to Ruth for representing the group in this way!

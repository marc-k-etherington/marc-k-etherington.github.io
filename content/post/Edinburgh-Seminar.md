Marc gave a seminar at the University of Edinburgh hosted by Dr Cate Anstoter and Dr Iain Wright. He presented some of the key results on the quinine salts work with Prof. Paul McGonigal and some of the latest results from the work of Ruth and Aidan where they are exploring the impact of changing the chromophore on the caged systems that provide a pathway to modular quinine-like molecules. Marc finished the trip to Edinburgh with a parkrun around Holyrood.

Marc and Aidan visited the University of Osaka in Japan to take part in the Kick-Off Meeting for the JST ASPIRE-funded project on 'X'.  This project aims to tackle a key modern challenge by utilising thermally activated delayed fluorescence in a new way. It brings together a global team lead by Dr Youhei Takeda at the University of Osaka. The other collaborators include Prof. Zac Hudson at the University of British Columbia, Prof. Piotr de Silva at the Technical University of Denmark, Prof. Go Watanabe at Kitasato University and our group at Northumbria University as the UK Lead. We are contributing key insights in terms of the photophysical characterisation of the newly developed molecules. We even had opportunity to visit a nice whisky bar that overlooked the river to continue our discussions.

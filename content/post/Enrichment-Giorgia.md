It was a great pleasure to host Dr Giorgia Marucci from HORIBA as part of our very first Enrichment Week in the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering at Northumbria University. Giorgia gave a great talk about her own career path and her role at HORIBA. Inspiring our 2nd year students to think about where their degree can take them.

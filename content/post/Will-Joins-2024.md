It was great to welcome Will Tetlow to the group as a PhD student after changing supervisor from Dr Giulia Longo who has taken up a new position in Spain. One of his first activities as a member of the group was to present work from his research secondment in the group of Dr Jonathan Scragg at Uppsala University.

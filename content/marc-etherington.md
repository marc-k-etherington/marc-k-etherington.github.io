Marc Etherington (b. 1988) started at Northumbria University in January 2020 as a Vice-Chancellor's Senior Fellow in the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Electrical Engineering. In 2022 he became Assistant Professor and he continues to lead his research in the spectroscopic study of organic light-emitting materials. Marc is also the lead of the Energy Futures Network at Northumbria an inter-faculty and interdisciplinary network that brings academics from across the University to work towards Carbon Net Zero. Marc works closely with colleagues in the Department of Applied Sciences, in particular Dr Jon Knowles with whom he shares co-supervision of PhD students to ensure the wider Knowles-Etherington Group can tackle synthetic and spectroscopic challenges in parallel.
